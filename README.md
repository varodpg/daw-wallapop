#### Data base entities attributes:

User: id(PK), name (UQ), email,  password, img ?, location
Product: id(PK), id_user(FK), id_category(FK), tags, imgs?, description, specifications, state, price
Category: id(PK), name
Friend_request: id(PK), from(FK), to(FK), mesage, state
Product_request: id(PK), from(FK), to(FK), product(FK), mesage, state

#### Advanced funcionality:
For the advanced funcionality we have thought to include personal recomendations based on your personal info like what you have bought, products near you, etc

#### Charts:
We are going to show the user history of purchases and his sales. And for more advanced stadistics we are going to show more info like the places that are more purchases, the bests categories, etc.

#### Funcionality with advanced technology:
To facilitate the contact of the users we will introduce a chat so they can talk in real time with their friends and with the sellers.
