# Dawllapop
This is a practice for the subject of web application development simulating the wallapop appp.

#### Development team:

#### Trello: https://trello.com/b/hSJ9ryp5/practica-daw

#### Data base entity diagram:

![alt text](https://github.com/varodpg/daw-wallapop/blob/master/diagrams/Entity%20diagram.png "Entity Diagram")

#### Data base entities attributes:

User: id(PK), name (UQ), email,  password, img ?, location
Product: id(PK), id_user(FK), id_category(FK), tags, imgs?, description, specifications, state, price
Category: id(PK), name
Friend_request: id(PK), from(FK), to(FK), mesage, state
Product_request: id(PK), from(FK), to(FK), product(FK), mesage, state

#### Advanced funcionality:
For the advanced funcionality we have thought to include personal recomendations based on your personal info like what you have bought, products near you, etc

#### Charts:
We are going to show the user history of purchases and his sales. And for more advanced stadistics we are going to show more info like the places that are more purchases, the bests categories, etc.

#### Funcionality with advanced technology:
To facilitate the contact of the users we will introduce a chat so they can talk in real time with their friends and with the sellers. 

#### Screenshots
Screenshots of the pages

1. Inicio: Main page from the Dawllapop web. Include some sections like "Products Near you", "Latest products added","products of interest" and search bar.

3. Perfil:  A simple view for an user profile. There are two profile pages: public and private. You can access to your products, my products for sale,my shopping, my sales,reviews, offers received and friend requests.
You can see the public information of an user from public profile.

### DEVELOPMENT EVIROMENT

To configure the development environment and to develop a Spring Boot application, we will need a program that provides us with the structure of the
packages to make the application as well as to manage the dependencies of Maven. To start we will download the program, we have used STS, which can be downloaded from the following link (https://spring.io/tools), once installed to create a project we will have to go to File -> New -> Sring Starter Project and we would have our project ready to start developing and working.

##DATABASE DIAGRAM

The following image show a diagram of the Entities database:

##CLASSES DIAGRAM

The following image show a diagram of the classes into the app: Controllers, services, repositories and HTML documents:

### STARTING THE APPLICATION:

Windows:
We need to have XAMPP installed to run the MYSQL process or MysqlCommunityServer.
We need to have Workbench installed to manage the tables.

The first thing we will do will be to give you start in the xampp part to start the MYSQL process, then we start the workbench and give you run to connect the database.
Finally we will give the run spring boot application in our sts and we could already access our application.

MacOs:
We need to have XAMPP installed to run the MYSQL process or MysqlCommunityServer.
We need to have Workbench installed to manage the tables.

First of all, we need intall MysqlCommunityServer and MysqlWorkbench, an IDE to manage the database. We also may manage the databse through the console terminal.
After that, we create a database with the name "daw" into MysqlWorkbench.
Finally we include the followinf lines into the application.properties file to indicate how to connect to the datase:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/daw
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop


Note: MacOs maybe will not add to the $PATH the mysql Server process. We need to run server into settings page and include it to the path into ~/.bash_profile
